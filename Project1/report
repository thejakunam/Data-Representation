Distances calculated using exponential formula are imperfect representations of relationships in data.
However, MDS works best on larger distances.

For lower values of alpha, the distance are larger and comparatively accurate. This is because stress function highlights discrepancies and therefore MDS performs better on these.

For higher values of alpha, MDS does not do a good job.
